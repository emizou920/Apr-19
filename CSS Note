17 mins pass the bridge

1 and 2 go first, the shortest go first(1, 2 go 1st)
the fastest one comes back(1 goes back)
the slowest two go together(5, 10 cross)
the 2nd fast goes back(2 goes back)
and the fast and 2nd fast go together(1 and 2 cross)

HW2 Problem 2
Just left the white ones in the middle not doing anything to it
int p1 = 0, p2 = colors.length -1, p1 =0;
while(p1<=p2)
 switch(colores[p1])
  case RED:
    swap(colors, p1, p0);
    p0++
    break;
  case WHITE:
    p1++;
    break;
  case BLUE:
    swap(colors, p1, p2);
    p2--;
    break;
    
private static void swap(int[]array, int 1, int j)
int temp = array[i];
array[i] = array[j];
array[j] = temp;

if the code has so many if-else statments, change to switch
